Global options
--------------

``xpdAcq`` has a ``glbl`` class that controls the overall behavior of the beamtime.
All of the attributes of the ``glbl`` class have reasonable default values, but
these can be interrogated and overwritten.

Possible scenarios
""""""""""""""""""

    **No automated dark collection logic at all:**

    .. code-block:: python

      glbl.auto_dark = False
      glbl.shutter_control = False

    **Want a fresh dark frame every time ``xrun`` is triggered:**

    .. code-block:: python

      glbl.dk_window = 0.001 # dark window is 0.001 min = 0.06 secs


    **Want a 0.2 exposure time per frame instead of 0.1s:**

    .. code-block:: python

      glbl.frame_acq_time = 0.2

    **Want to run temperature ramp with different device and use alternative shutter:**

    .. code-block:: python

      glbl.temp_controller = eurotherm
      glbl.shutter = shctl2

    .. note::

      desired objects should be properly *configured*. For more details, please contact beamline staff.
